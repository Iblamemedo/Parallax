# Parallax
An open-source, DIY PC VR headset with inside-out tracking.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
Project Parallax aims to create an accessible, fully open-source VR system that rivals commercial headsets while remaining affordable and 3D-printable. Built on the shoulders of the open VR community, Parallax combines inside-out tracking, aspherical optics, and capacitive finger tracking into a complete PCVR solution.

# Note
This is my first project, so I might face some challenges, but I will do my best.
